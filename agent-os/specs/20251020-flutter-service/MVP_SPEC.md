# Specification: Flutter Service MVP (Item #3a)

> **🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER - January 2025**
>
> **This spec is BLOCKED pending research outcome.**
>
> **Issue:** Flutter Driver (basis of appium-flutter-driver) was deprecated in Flutter 3.19 (2024).
> **Impact:** Entire technical approach may not be viable with current Flutter versions.
> **Action:** 1-2 week research spike to investigate alternatives (Patrol, integration_test wrappers, etc.)
> **Decision Point:** End of Week 2 - GO/NO-GO on Flutter service entirely
>
> See: `/agent-os/specs/20251020-flutter-service/CRITICAL_BLOCKER.md`

**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - Research Phase
**Timeline:** TBD (pending research outcome)
**Scope:** Android (emulator) + macOS (desktop) *if technically feasible*
**Parent Item:** #3 Flutter Service (split into #3a MVP + #3b Expansion)

## Goal

Create a minimal viable Flutter service (`@wdio/flutter-service`) that proves the technical approach works on 2 platforms (Android mobile + macOS desktop) before committing to full multi-platform support. Validates Appium Flutter Driver integration, binary detection patterns, and establishes foundation for platform expansion.

## Why MVP First?

### Lessons from Item #2 Cancellation
- **Avoid premature abstraction** - Don't build for 5 platforms until we prove 2 works
- **Early validation** - Catch issues at week 6 instead of week 17
- **Manageable risk** - 4-6 weeks is trackable, 12-17 weeks is too long
- **Faster feedback** - Working prototype enables user testing sooner

### Platform Selection Rationale
**Android (Mobile):**
- ✅ Most accessible mobile platform (emulator easier than iOS simulator)
- ✅ Critical for "desktop-mobile-testing" repository name
- ✅ Large user base (most Flutter devs target Android)
- ✅ GitHub Actions has good Android emulator support
- ✅ No Apple developer account or macOS required for development

**macOS (Desktop):**
- ✅ Same platform as Electron development/testing
- ✅ Desktop testing is proven (Electron service works)
- ✅ Available in existing CI infrastructure
- ✅ Validates desktop approach alongside mobile

**Deferred to Item #3b:**
- iOS (complex simulator setup, real device requirements, Apple ecosystem)
- Windows (requires Windows runners, different build tools)
- Linux (different desktop environment, AppImage/Snap considerations)

## User Stories

### Core MVP Stories
- As a Flutter Android developer, I want to test my APK with WebdriverIO so that I can validate widget interactions
- As a Flutter macOS developer, I want to test my .app bundle with WebdriverIO so that I can validate desktop functionality
- As a test engineer, I want automatic binary detection so that I don't manually configure paths
- As a CI engineer, I want the service to work in GitHub Actions so that I can run automated tests

### Deferred Stories (Item #3b)
- iOS testing (simulator + real device)
- Windows desktop testing
- Linux desktop testing
- Advanced widget testing features
- Performance profiling
- Screenshot/video capture

## MVP Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Package Setup
- ✅ Create `@wdio/flutter-service` package in monorepo
- ✅ Dual ESM/CJS build using bundler (copy from Electron)
- ✅ TypeScript with proper type definitions
- ✅ Package structure following Electron conventions
- ✅ Dependencies: Appium client (webdriverio), minimal Flutter-specific deps

#### FR2: Binary Detection (Android + macOS)
- ✅ Detect Android APK at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
- ✅ Detect macOS .app at `build/macos/Build/Products/Debug/YourApp.app`
- ✅ Parse `pubspec.yaml` for app name and metadata
- ✅ Support debug and release build modes
- ✅ Provide helpful errors when binary not found
- ✅ Support manual binary path override
- ❌ iOS/Windows/Linux detection (deferred to #3b)

#### FR3: Appium Integration
- ✅ Validate Appium server is running (don't manage lifecycle - assume external)
- ✅ Validate `appium-flutter-driver` is installed
- ✅ Configure Appium connection (host/port)
- ✅ Handle connection errors gracefully
- ❌ Auto-start Appium server (keep simple - user manages Appium)
- ❌ Appium version compatibility checking (future enhancement)

#### FR4: Capability Configuration
- ✅ Auto-configure Android capabilities (platformName, app path, etc.)
- ✅ Auto-configure macOS capabilities (platformName, app path, etc.)
- ✅ Support custom capability overrides
- ✅ Merge service-level and capability-level configs
- ❌ Device selection (emulator/real device) - use defaults
- ❌ Platform version specification - use system defaults
- ❌ Multiremote configurations (deferred)

#### FR5: Core Flutter Commands
**Element Finding (Priority):**
- ✅ `browser.flutter.byValueKey(key)` - Most common Flutter selector
- ✅ `browser.flutter.byType(type)` - Find by widget type
- ✅ `browser.flutter.byText(text)` - Find by text content

**Interactions (Priority):**
- ✅ `browser.flutter.tap(element)` - Tap widget
- ✅ `browser.flutter.enterText(element, text)` - Enter text
- ✅ `browser.flutter.scroll(params)` - Scroll view

**Waiting (Priority):**
- ✅ `browser.flutter.waitForWidget(selector)` - Wait for widget to appear

**Deferred Commands (#3b):**
- bySemanticsLabel, byTooltip (less common selectors)
- scrollUntilVisible, drag, longPress (advanced interactions)
- waitForAbsent, waitUntilNoTransientCallbacks (advanced waiting)
- getText, isPresent, isVisible (can use standard WebdriverIO commands)
- getWidgetTree (debugging - nice to have)

#### FR6: Service Lifecycle
**Launcher Service (onPrepare/onComplete):**
- ✅ Implement launcher extending `Services.ServiceInstance`
- ✅ `onPrepare`: Validate Appium, detect binaries, configure capabilities
- ✅ `onComplete`: Cleanup (if needed)
- ✅ Copy structure from Electron's `ElectronLaunchService`

**Worker Service (before/after hooks):**
- ✅ Implement service extending `Services.ServiceInstance`
- ✅ `before`: Register Flutter commands on browser instance
- ✅ `after`: Cleanup resources
- ✅ Copy structure from Electron's `ElectronWorkerService`

#### FR7: Configuration
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for all options
- ✅ Support environment variables for CI (e.g., `FLUTTER_APP_PATH`)
- ✅ Parse `pubspec.yaml` for project metadata
- ✅ Simple validation (required fields only)
- ❌ Zod schema validation (keep simple for MVP)

- ❌ Comprehensive E2E suite (deferred to #3b)

#### NFR3: CI/CD
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for Android emulator tests
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for macOS tests
- ✅ Reuse Electron's CI patterns
- ❌ iOS simulator setup (complex, deferred)
- ❌ Windows/Linux runners (deferred)

### Binary Detection Strategy
```typescript
// Simplified approach for MVP
interface BinaryPaths {
  android: string; // build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
  macos: string;   // build/macos/Build/Products/Debug/{AppName}.app
}

async function detectBinary(platform: 'android' | 'macos'): Promise<string> {
  // 1. Check manual override
  // 2. Parse pubspec.yaml for app name
  // 3. Check standard build output location
  // 4. Return path or throw helpful error
}
```

### Appium Assumptions (Simplified for MVP)
- User has Appium installed globally (`npm install -g appium`)
- User has installed `appium-flutter-driver` (`appium driver install --source=npm appium-flutter-driver`)
- Appium server is running before tests (`appium` or `appium --port 4723`)
- Service validates connection but doesn't manage lifecycle

### Capability Configuration
```typescript
// Android
{
  platformName: 'Android',
  'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
  'appium:app': '/path/to/app-debug.apk',
  'appium:deviceName': 'emulator-5554', // Default emulator
  'appium:noReset': true,
}

// macOS
{
  platformName: 'mac',
  'appium:automationName': 'Flutter',
  'appium:app': '/path/to/YourApp.app',
}
```

**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High

### Risk 2: Android Emulator CI Complexity
**Risk:** Emulator setup in CI is flaky or slow
**Mitigation:** Use established actions (reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner), budget time for troubleshooting
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
