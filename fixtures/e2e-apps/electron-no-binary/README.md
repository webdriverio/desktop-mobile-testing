# electron-no-binary

An ESM project for a minimal Electron app, designed to provide E2E testing for `wdio-electron-service`.

The app has not been built but has been bundled.

**Note**: This E2E app uses ESM only. CJS/ESM module system testing is done in package tests (see `fixtures/package-tests/`).
