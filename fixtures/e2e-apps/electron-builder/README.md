# electron-builder

An ESM project for a minimal Electron app, designed to provide E2E testing for `wdio-electron-service`.

The app is built using `electron-builder` and is not bundled.

**Note**: This E2E app uses ESM only. CJS/ESM module system testing is done in package tests (see `fixtures/package-tests/`).
