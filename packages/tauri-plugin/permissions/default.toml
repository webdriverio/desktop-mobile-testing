# WebDriverIO Tauri Plugin Permissions
#
# This file defines the ACL (Access Control List) permissions for the wdio plugin.
# These permissions control which commands apps can invoke from the frontend.
#
# Permission Structure:
# - [default]: The default permission set that includes all plugin commands
# - [allow-*]: Individual permissions for each command
#
# Usage in Apps:
# Add to your app's capabilities file (e.g., capabilities/default.json):
#   "wdio:allow-execute",
#   "wdio:allow-set-mock",
#   etc.
#
# Or use the default set:
#   "wdio:default"
#
# For more on Tauri v2 permissions: https://v2.tauri.app/security/capabilities/
