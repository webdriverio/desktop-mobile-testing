# Development

## Setup

See the [Monorepo Setup Guide](../../docs/setup.md) for prerequisites, cloning, installing dependencies, building, and common workflows.

## Dependency Management

The project uses a catalog system to manage Electron versions across three catalogs:

| Catalog | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `default` | Stable production versions | `electron: "catalog:default"` → `^32.0.1` |
| `next` | Latest/nightly builds | `electron-nightly: "catalog:next"` |
| `minimum` | Lowest supported versions | `electron: "catalog:minimum"` → `^28.0.0` |

See [Dependency Management](../../docs/setup.md#dependency-management) for catalog switching and update commands.

For the `next` catalog specifically, the update process:
- Fetches the latest `electron-nightly` version from npm
- Compares all available tags (next, beta, alpha, latest) by full semantic version
- Prioritizes cutting-edge tags in order: next > beta > alpha > latest
- Removes the `electron` dependency (only `electron-nightly` is used in this catalog)

## Development Mode

```bash
# Rebuild all packages on changes
pnpm dev

# Rebuild a specific package
pnpm dev --filter "@wdio/native-utils"
```

## Testing

### E2E Tests

```bash
pnpm test:e2e-local
pnpm test:e2e-mac-universal-local
```

Task graphs:

![E2E Task Graph](../.github/assets/e2e-graph.png 'E2E Task Graph')
![Mac Universal E2E Task Graph](../.github/assets/e2e-graph-mac-universal.png 'Mac Universal E2E Task Graph')

Enable debug output for all namespaces:

```bash
DEBUG=wdio-electron-service:* pnpm test:e2e-local
```

All E2E test applications use [electron-vite](https://electron-vite.org).

### Update E2E Task Graphs

```bash
pnpm graph
```

### Unit Tests

```bash
# All unit tests (from repo root)
pnpm test:unit

# Watch mode (from package directory)
pnpm test:dev
```

## Release

Project maintainers publish releases using GitHub Actions. The release workflow supports both manual triggers and automated releases via PR labels.

### Autorelease (Recommended)

1. Add labels to your PR: `scope:electron` and a version label like `release:major`
2. After CI passes and the PR is merged, the release workflow automatically publishes

### Manual Release

1. Go to Actions → Release
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select scope (`electron`), version type, and dry run option

### Version Types

- `patch`, `minor`, `major` - Stable releases
- `prepatch`, `preminor`, `premajor`, `prerelease` - Pre-releases

### Pre-releases

Use prerelease labels for testing:
- `scope:electron` + `release:premajor` → Electron packages as premajor (e.g., 11.0.0-beta.0)
